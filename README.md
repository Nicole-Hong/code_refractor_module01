# Modeul 1: HTML CSS Git Challenge (Code Refactor)

As an odd-numbered week, this week's Challenge was an on-the-job ticket, where a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. As a junior web developer, I was required to modify the starter code and refractor it to complete the online marketing campaign, and to showcase the accessibility of the existing site, which is a very important aspect of web development.
